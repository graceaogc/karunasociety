      <h4>Karuna Kendra Study Center:</h4>
      <div class="multicolumn">
        <p>It is an unfortunate fact,  that over 40% of the population in India lives on less than $2 per day. Majority of India's population survive below the poverty line. Many of us have grown tolerant to this statistic and have left the responsibility of helping them to the government or NGOs. And this might be simply because we believe that our efforts wouldn't solve the bigger problem anyway.</p>
        <p>We believe that every life changed is a contribution towards reversing the statistics. Reaching lives one at a time. At our Karuna Kendra Study Centers we encourage children to attain basic education. We provide tutoring, supplies, tuition fee, clothing, and food. These study centers help them stay motivated to stay in school, better their lives and move out of their current situation. </p>
        <p>We are fortunate to have wonderful teachers, counsellors and medical professionals who meet with the children and their parents/guardians on a regular basis to educate them in issues that are of importance and could change their habits bringing improvement in the society.</p>

        <p>Stronger Than Espresso is a venture of Karuna Welfare Society for the betterment of women suffering from domestic violence and abuse. Our counselors cover each area every week on daily basis and counsel women on their issues. Hygiene is distributed bi- monthly and its use and benefits are inculcated as well.</p>

      <h4>Covid Releif 2020:</h4>
      <div class="multicolumn">
        <p>At the start of this year with the Covid-19 pandemic hitting the entire world, those living under the poverty line were hit even harder. Loss of jobs led to lack of food, and they were unable to have proper protective measures to combat this pandemic.</p>
        <p>Karuna Welfare Society did not ignore the problem but rallied to be part of the solution. Since April 2020, we have been able to provide food supplies, masks, sanitizers for those who live under the poverty line and refreshments and food packets to those who were returning by foot to their native villages.</p>
        <p>We were also able to raise awareness and get people to donate blankets and other beddings for those living on the streets due to financial challenges.</p>
        <p>As of December 2020, we have helped over 5,000 families and we are looking to help more if the situation worsens. If you want to partner with us and help us help others, please feel free to contact us.</p>
